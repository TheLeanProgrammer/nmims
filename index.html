                    <p>Read the problem, start thinking about it and if possible write the things that are given and the

                        <li>What would be the output for those inputs</li>
                        <li>Can you separate out some modules or parts from the problem?</li>

                        <li>Take more complex and bigger inputs to see what will be the output, how many use cases do we
                            want</li>

                        <li>Divide the problem into different modules or sub-problems</li>
                        <li>Try to make independent functions for each sub-problem</li>
                        <li>Connect those sub-problems by calling them in the required order, or as necessary</li>
                        <li>Try to use classes and objects while handling questions which try to implement some
                            real-world problem (like management systems, etc.)</li>

                    <p style="font-size: 25px;">Now that you’ve analyzed the problem it’s time to actually write the
                        code. If you can’t solve the problem fully at once, try writing code for a simpler sub part, as
                        you solve the problem, gradually you keep figuring out the problem in more detail, and you start
                        getting new ideas.</p>
